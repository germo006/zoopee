%%%%Brianna M. Garcia - 07/14/222 version 2.0 (considerSkyline_v2.m)
%%%%Script edited use the lowest concentration standard for fitering 
%%%%concentrations less then this value rather than the previously used
%%%%mean(blanks) where blanks were MQ water. This is due to baseline issues in
%%%%Skyline resulting in high light/heavy area ratios for the MQ water which
%%%%is not a problem on the TSQ. 

function [sampleNames, keepGoodData] = considerSkyline(...
    exportedSkyline, sampleInfoFile, ionMode, SILISType,nSILIS)
% considerSkyline V0 : This function is called by riSkyline.m and is
% responsible for quantification of metabolites via a five-point standard
% curve. It calculates LOD and LOQ as well. Quantification is based on a
% ratio to heavy spike (13C6) with the exception of any metabolite with a
% '0' in its name. These were not derivatized by benzoyl chloride and
% therefore would not have a heavy label. 

% INPUT %
% 1. exportedSkyline: name of the *.csv exported from Skyline. Must contain
% at least columns for peak area (both light and heavy), sample type, sample
% filename, molecule name, and "analyte concentration" (this is for known
% concentrations like standards and spikes).
% 2. sampleInfoFile: the modified sequence file containing file names and
% condition information (*.xslx)
% 3. ionMode: can be "neg" or "pos"
% 4. SILISType: can be 'heavyD5' or 'heavyC13'
% 5. nSILIS: can be 1 or 2

info = readtable(sampleInfoFile); 
%reduce info to only samples in the current analysis.

info = info(strcmp(ionMode, info.ionMode),:); 

% Now we have read the two files necessary for quantification. Since we're
% quantifying based on precursor ions, this is a way to pick that out.
data.precursor = (data.FragmentIonType == "precursor" &...
    data.IsotopeLabelType == "light");

compoundList = table(unique(data.MoleculeName, 'stable'),'VariableNames', {'names'});

% What considerMAVEN did here was to make sure that all molecules measured
% had a confirm fragment--for the way we're using Lumos data, we have
% quantification by the precursor and one or more confirm MS2 fragments, as
% opposed to MS2 fragments for both the quant and confirm ions. It would be
% useful to check that the confirm ions appear. At this stage, it does not
% appear that I *have* reliable confirm ions for all my targets. 
% To-do: get a reliable confirm for all ions. 

% CHECKING CONFIRM IONS
% Skyline does not output data rows where it doesn't find the ion, unlike
% our prior approach to MAVEN, where ions that aren't found simply don't
% appear in the export. The transition won't have any exported data if it
% is entirely absent, but will export rows for samples in which the
% transition is found. 
% *This means that for a given ion, #samples does not necessarily equal
% #records. 
% Here I will check for the confirm ion by
% evaluating if the confirm had a nonzero peak area in *all* non-blank
% samples.
